# StartReactNativeProject
Today I decided to switch to React Native CLI from Expo. Initial setup, configuration and settings took a lot of time. Also, in order to be more productive within coding I added ESlint which finds and fixes problems in JavaScript code. In order to reduce time for creating next projects I decided to make Github Project where all configurations are made so check it out.

ESlint configurtion:
